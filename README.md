Hi, Iâ€™m Austin Shaw. I am currently a quality engineer who works on consumer goods in the outdoor industry. 
However, my main interest is using Python to read, manipulate, analyze, and visualize data.
I am experienced using the Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries in Python to work with data comfortably.
I have built lots of Python scripts in my current role to automate common excel tasks and to visualize test data.
I am currently learning more about data science using Python. 
I have taken Jose Portilla's '2021 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass' course on Udemy.com as well as his SQL course also on Udemy.com.
I am learning about the mathematics/statistics behind different machine learning models as well as how to implement them and search for the best hyperparameters using Python's Sci-Kit Learn library.
I am happy to collaborate on any projects! Feel free to contact me at ashaw121@gmail.com or via LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-shaw-2724b58b/
