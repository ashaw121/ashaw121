Hi, Iâ€™m Austin Shaw. I am currently a quality engineer who works on consumer goods in the outdoor industry. I also work part time doing technical project management on software projects for a consulting firm. 
However, my main interest is programming, working with data, and software engineering. I am most experienced working with Python for data analysis and visualization, but I have also been learning HTML/CSS/Javascript for web developemnt.
I have built many Python scripts in my career to automate common excel tasks and to visualize test data.
I have taken Jose Portilla's '2021 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass' course on Udemy.com, his SQL course also on Udemy.com, I have been working through Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete Javascript course for web development on udemy, and have been working through lessons on FreeCodeCamp.org and theodinproject.com.

I am happy to collaborate on any projects! Feel free to contact me at ashaw121@gmail.com or via LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-shaw-2724b58b/
