Hi, Iâ€™m Austin Shaw. I am currently a quality engineer who works on consumer goods in the outdoor industry. I also work part time doing technical project management on software projects for a digital agency. 

However, my main interest is programming, working with data, and software engineering. I am most experienced working with Python for data analysis and visualization, but I have also been learning HTML/CSS/Javascript for web developemnt.

I am happy to collaborate on any projects! Feel free to contact me at ashaw121@gmail.com or via LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-shaw-2724b58b/
